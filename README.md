# Redis_Win
The Redis_Win project enables you to run the latest version of Redis on a windows environment.



The build environment we used were the Cygwin.


How to use it

We will keep our Redis version to the latest version.
You can download the Redis for Windows on the release pages.
Before you use it as in an Unix-Like operating system,you must unzip the zip file and add the location to the $PATH Environment.
After that,open a shell like powershell or cmd.
Type "redis-server"
Enjoy it~!
